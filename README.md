# Personal Project: Phase 0

## Introduction

This application will suggest meals the user can cook based on the ingredients 
the user has added to reflect what they have in their fridge and/or pantry.
The application gives users the option to filter their 
search for meal suggestions based on the amount of time they have to cook 
and their dietary restrictions. 
The user may also be able to gain access to suggestions for desserts they can make
if they choose to rate a recipe.

Figuring out what to make for lunch or dinner is something many adults 
struggle with. Often times, people are tired when they come home from work or school, 
so they don't want to spend time or energy thinking about what to make.
A pantry-to-meal application would be great for people who don't have a lot of time
but also don't want to spend money, such as students and families with young children.
However, the application would be helpful for basically everybody since most people have 
to cook for themselves at least once a week. This project interests me because
I am a student who does not have a lot of time in between classes, but I also prefer not 
to buy food from places on campus because they are expensive. For these reasons, a meal suggestion
generating application would save me a lot of time.
