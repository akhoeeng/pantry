# Personal Project: Phase 0

## Introduction

This application will suggest meal recipes based on the ingredients 
the user has added to reflect what they have in their fridge and/or pantry.
The application prepares recipe suggestions after virtually discarding 
any ingredients that are expired.
The application also creates a list of recommended recipes for the user 
based on their previous searches, and another list called "make again"
for recipes the user has previously made and stated they enjoyed. The application may also
have a points system where the user can collect points from rating recipes.
The user would then be able to gain access to certain dessert recipes 
based on the number of points they have earned.

Figuring out what to make for lunch or dinner is something many adults 
struggle with. Often times, people are tired when they come home from work or school, 
so they don't want to spend time or energy thinking about what to make.
A pantry-to-recipe application would be great for people who don't have a lot of time
but also don't want to spend money, such as students and families with young children.
However, the application would be helpful for basically everybody since most people have 
to cook for themselves at least once a week. This project interests me because
I am a student who does not have a lot of time in between classes, but I also prefer not 
to buy food from places on campus because they are expensive. For these reasons, a recipe
generating application would save me a lot of time.
