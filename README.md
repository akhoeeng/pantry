# Personal Project: Phase 0

## Introduction

This application will allow users to add and remove items from their pantry and see everything they have in their 
pantry without having to search through anything. When items are added or  removed from the user's pantry, 
users can see how much of the item they have left. Users can also flag an ingredient as 'TO BUY'. Items that are flagged
will be added to a grocery list, which gets displayed to the user after they flag something.

Searching through an entire fridge or pantry to determine what you need to buy from the grocery store is time-consuming.
Often times, people are tired when they come home from work or school, so they don't want to spend time or energy 
going through their entire pantry and/or fridge. A virtual pantry application would be great for people who don't have 
a lot of time, such as students and families with young children. However, the application would be helpful for 
basically everybody since most people have to buy groceries and cook for themselves at least once a week. This project
interests me because I live with other people, so I don't always notice when something is running low or gets used up.
Having an app that keeps track of the amounts of everything in our pantry would save me lots of time when I 
go to the grocery store every week.
